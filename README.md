This application contains three functionality, and each functionality is independent. 

In my program, the three java classes named function1, function2 and function3 show the implementation of each functionality. In order to test each of them, I defined five text files.

In each function, I have also defined the method to read the content of txt file, but to ensure the successful compilation of each test, please do check the correct path of testing file in the program.

In function1, the two main operations are build-heap and heaping. And the test files contain a series of random integers (the maximal input size is 1000), and the output after testing should be a list of sorted Integers.

In function2, the two main operations are inserting and searching. And the test files contain several data items, each data item has a deadline as key and address as address (the maximal input size is 25), and the output after testing should be an address.

I wrote the program in IntelliJ IDEA. and as for running the codes in the terminal, first go to the directory of this java program, and then type "javac program name " to compile the program, after that type "java program name" to run the program.
